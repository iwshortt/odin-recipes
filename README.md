# odin-recipes
Building a basic recipe website
This project consists of using my knowlede of HTML, git and github, alongside understanding the basics of navigating the terminal through vscode in order to create a basic recipe website. The website will include a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. From github i will create a new repository and a README.md file, which i will then clone onto my local machine using my unique SSH key. I will then create a new "index.html" file within my "odin-recipes" directory which will become the "homepage" of my website. Within this index-file i will set my !DOCTYPE to html and fill out the usual boilerplate and add an h1 heading "Odin Recipes" to the body.
<!-- i may have gone too far. consider ending after "links to a few recipes. -->

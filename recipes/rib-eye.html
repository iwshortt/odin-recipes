        <h1>PAN SEARED CAST IRON RIB-EYE</h1>

        <h2>The King of all Steak Cuts</h2>
            <p>Our signature cast iron ribeye steak is so tender, mouth-watering, and well-marbled, and in my opinion, ribeye is the king of all steak cuts. Seared in oil with the skillet and basted in butter, then finished by melting a garlic herb butter on top.</p>
        <h2>Tips for Cooking Steaks</h2>
            <p>If you want your steak to taste delicious and remain tender as possible while cooking, remember to keep these tips in mind;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose a thick cut with good marbling for a moist, flavorful steak.</li>
                    <li>Bring the steak to room temperature, coat all sides with kosher salt, and pat dry 40 minutes before cooking for a perfect crispy finish</li>
                    <li>Sear on high heat for a delicious crust and a soft, juicy center.</li>
                    <li>Finish offcuts thicker than 1/2 inch in the oven.</li>
                    <li>For maximum flavor, baste the steak with butter during the final stages of cooking.</li>
                    <li>Rest the steak after cooking to ensure the steak retains its juices</li>
                    <li>Make the steak sauce in the same pan, so the gelatin thighs from the meat thicken it and add flavor.</li>
                </ol>
        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <h4>Serves 1</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>One bone-out ribeye steak, 1.5-In thick</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp Canola oil to coat pan</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
                <li>Kerrygold Garlic aand Herb butter</li>
                <li>1 bunch of woody herbs, e.g. rosemary or thyme, whole</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>COOKING INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a 10-12 inch cast-iron skillet in a 500˚F oven. Remove the ribeye from the refrigerator, and bring it to room temperature.</li>
                <li>Once the oven reaches 500˚F, remove the skillet from the oven and place it on the stove over a high heat for 5 minutes. Lightly coat the steak with oil and generously season all sides with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                <li>Instantly place the ribeye in the center of the hot skillet, along with the woody herbs. Sear for 30 seconds; dont move the ribeye. Turn the ribeye over with tongs, and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Turn over the steak again and sear for an additional 30 seconds, remove the woody herbs,  then place the skillet straight forward into the oven for 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place the herb butter on top of the ribeye. Remove the steak out from skillet, place it on a plate, cover loosely with foil, and rest for 2 minutes as butter melts</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Tips: If you prefer medium-cooked steak, add a minute to each turn. </p>
